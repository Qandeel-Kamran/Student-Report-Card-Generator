📚 Project: Student Marks Input System with Grade Calculation 🎓
Overview:
This Python-based project allows users to input student marks across various subjects, automatically calculates the total marks, percentage, and assigns a grade based on performance. The system provides personalized feedback to motivate students and encourages them to keep improving. It supports the entry of multiple student records until the user decides to stop. 🌟

✨ Features:
Dynamic Data Input: Collects the student’s name, roll number, and marks for 8 subjects.
Automated Calculations: Calculates the total marks (out of 800) and percentage automatically. 🔢
Grade Assignment: Assigns a grade based on the student’s percentage: A+, A, B, C, or F. 🏅
Motivational Feedback: Provides positive feedback based on the grade to encourage continuous improvement. 💪
Multiple Record Entries: The user can enter multiple student records continuously until they choose to stop. 🔄
📊 Grade Criteria:
A+ (80% - 99%): 🌟 Excellent work! Keep up the amazing work! 💯
A (70% - 79%): 👍 Great job! You're doing really well, keep it up!
B (60% - 69%): 🏃‍♂️ Good effort! With a little more practice, you can do even better!
C (50% - 59%): ✅ You passed! Keep working hard and aim for higher goals!
F (Below 50%): 🚀 Don’t be discouraged! Review your mistakes and improve next time.
🔧 How the Program Works:
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter their name, roll number, and the marks for the following subjects:
Mathematics 🧮
Urdu 📖
Science 🔬
Islamiat 📚
Computer Science 💻
Pakistan Studies (PST) 🇵🇰
Sindhi 🌍
English ✍️
Calculations:

Total Marks: The program sums the marks for each subject.
Percentage: The total marks are divided by the maximum possible marks (800), and the result is multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. 📊
Grade & Feedback: Based on the percentage, the program assigns a grade and provides personalized feedback to motivate the student. 🎉
Record Insertion:

After entering the student’s data, their record is displayed. 🗂️
The user is asked whether they want to input another record. The process repeats until the user chooses 'N' to stop. 🛑
📝 Example Usage:
yaml
Copy
Enter your name: Fatima
Enter your rollnumber: 001
Enter your marks for each subject (out of 100):

Math: 76
Urdu: 46
Science: 86
Islamiat: 94
Computer: 46
PST: 75
Sindhi: 35
English: 36

Good effort! You've earned a **C** grade. With more practice, you can do even better. 🌟
